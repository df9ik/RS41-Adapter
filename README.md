# RS41-programming-adapter

For programming the Radiosonde RS41 you need a adapter from the ST-Link plug (2.5mm) to the sondes plug (2mm).

I use this parts from my favourite seller:

1 highquality Board
1 connector 2,5mm 5x2
1 connector 2mm 5x2

You can order some boards for 3.-€ plus postage. Please send a Email.
You can also order the boards direct at aisler.

Note:
They have no shipping costs and send worldwide!
You have to order at least 3 boards with a total amound of 8.40€.

The connectors are not ideal, but ok.
I ordered them at Reichelt Elektronik http://reichelt.de

Have fun
